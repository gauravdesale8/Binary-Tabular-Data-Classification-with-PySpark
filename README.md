# Binary-Tabular-Data-Classification-with-PySpark

This project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning model for a binary classification problem using PySpark. The objective is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually based on data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census.

The project will explore several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each algorithm will be trained and evaluated, and those with superior predictive performance will be selected for further analysis.

The primary metric for evaluating the model's performance will be the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The ROC curve provides insight into how well the model distinguishes between two classes, with values closer to 1 indicating a better model.

The project's ultimate goal is to identify potential high-income individuals who are likely to donate to charity, thus solving a binary classification problem where we classify individuals into two categories: those who earn more than $50,000 per year (class 1) and those who do not (class 0).
